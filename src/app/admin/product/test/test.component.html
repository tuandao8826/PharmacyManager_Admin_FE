    Most common case is showing data from backend API and with ng-select this is extremely simple since you can bind
    directly to observable
    when using angular <b> | async</b> pipe
  </p>
  
  <ng-select style="width: 400px;" [items]="people$ | async" bindLabel="name" autofocus bindValue="id"
    [(ngModel)]="selectedPersonId" [searchFn]="customSearchFn" placeholder="Search by name or age..."> </ng-select>
  
  <br />Selected: {{ selectedPersonId }}
